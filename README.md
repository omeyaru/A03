Creating a repository can be done from the github website. After creating the account, click the + sign in the upper right corner, and click create new repository. This can also be done from Webstorm if you choose to do so.

Once you've created an account, download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
To add files to Git, click add, and browse your system then select the file. To push a change to a repository, press CTRL+SHIFT+K, and that file will now be uploaded and updated onto the proper repository on GitHub.
